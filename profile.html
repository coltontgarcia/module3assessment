		<p>Not a lot of people know much about me. I grew up relatively poor, we went bankrupt when i was the age of 7. My dad somehow got us out of that rut and now makes 250k/yr (ballpark). I have a couple hobbies, but not as much as I used to. I used to play a lot of fortnite, so much so that i competed in tournaments and made around 3 grand. I spend most of my freetime with my girlfriend, eating Raising Cane's(that shit is so good), or cuddling with my gorgeous cat (not her but another cute kitty)</p>
